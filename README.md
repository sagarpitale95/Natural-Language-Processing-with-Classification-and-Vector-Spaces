# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Classification-and-Vector-Spaces
Part of the 4-course series Natural Language Processing Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai

You will learn following objectives:

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 

b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and

c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

Please go through the repository for cross checking of your assignments and reference for lab sessions.
